Thus you can write a Python program that works as a pipeline to run a very complex bash script and format it to be easily readable and executable in Python.

    "### Blocking and asynchronous execution\n",
    "When you send a subprocess to be run it is actually being executed on a separate thread from the one that is running Python. In essence, you are running *parallel code* when you run a subprocess. We'll talk much more about parallel code in later weeks. But this is our first introduction to the idea. The simplest code for running subprocess is to use the function `.communicate()` which will **block** your Python code from being able to execute any more commands until the subprocess is finished. This can be useful if your next piece of code depends on the results of the subprocess. However, other times we might be interested in doing something else while the subprocess is running, in that case we will run *asynchronous* code, meaning that we can continue calling Python code and query the code the object to ask whether it is finished or not. Below are examples of both. "

This can save us the trouble of having to write an input or output file, since we can just pipe string data into the program, and catch the stdout as a string. That is much more efficient.

The fasta sequence alignment format can be seen above. In it, each sequence has a line for the name which starts with \">\" and then the following line has the sequence. Raxml also supporta a different sequence format called \"phylip\", in which the names and sequences are on the same line, and there is no \">\" at the beginning of names.

In addition, raxml writes it's log information to stdout instead of stderr. Again, this is just something that some developers do. Because the output is always written to a file for raxml it doesn't really matter whether the log is written to stderr or stdout. Here we use the required argument `-n` to give a name to the output file. If an output file with that name already exists then it will raise an error. \n",
