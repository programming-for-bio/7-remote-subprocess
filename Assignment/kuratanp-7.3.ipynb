    "### SSH Tunneling with jupyter\n",
    "So far we have only ran jupyter notebooks locally on our own machines. However, you may remember that in class I have referred to jupyter as a **notebook server**. The word server here is in fact the same term that we mean when we talk about a server that hosts websites. It is something that can send and recieve information over the internet, and which renders its results in a browser. Jupyter notebooks are a visual representation of the outputs produced when information is sent back and forth to the server. Because jupyter notebook servers are capable of exchanging information over the internet, we can actually run a server remotely, such as on the HPC cluster, and still interact with the notebook just like it was running on our local machine by connecting to it through a browser. In this notebook we will walk through how to set this up. "
