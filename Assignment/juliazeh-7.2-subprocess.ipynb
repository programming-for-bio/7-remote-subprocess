    "One of the most powerful uses of Python is in creating **pipelines** programs, a program that calls other programs (sometimes many of them) and returns nicely formatted results. Python is really nice for this because it is such a good language for parsing text files (results), and because it is easily readable. Thus you can write a Python program that works as a pipeline to run a very complex bash script and format it to be easily readable and executable in Python. Below is a simple example that calls `ls -l` to list the files in our current directory. We'll explain the functions in greater detail soon. \n"

    "### Blocking and asynchronous execution\n",
    "When you send a subprocess to be run it is actually being executed on a separate thread from the one that is running Python. In essence, you are running *parallel code* when you run a subprocess. We'll talk much more about parallel code in later weeks. But this is our first introduction to the idea. The simplest code for running subprocess is to use the function `.communicate()` which will **block** your Python code from being able to execute any more commands until the subprocess is finished. This can be useful if your next piece of code depends on the results of the subprocess. However, other times we might be interested in doing something else while the subprocess is running, in that case we will run *asynchronous* code, meaning that we can continue calling Python code and query the code the object to ask whether it is finished or not. Below are examples of both. "

It takes as a required argument list of commands where each element in the list is a separate part of an argument that would normally be separated by a space in the command line string. The example below splits `\"ls -l\"` into `[\"ls\", \"-l\"]`. It can then take additional arguments that tell it how to redirect the stdin, stderr, and stdout. These are important for directing output either to files, or to be parsed as a string directly.

    "Below we will call the two programs we installed at the top of this notebook. The first is a sequence alignment program called `muscle`. It takes as input a file with genetic sequence data in `fasta` format and uses an algorithm to find the optimal alignment of the sequences (the alignment that minimized the number of differences among them.) This type of operation is commonly used when doing phylogenetic analyses to ensure that homologous sites are being compared when searching for genetic substitutions. Muscle uses the following syntax: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "muscle -in <fasta file> -out <fasta file>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is also written so that if no `-out` argument is provided then it simply pipes its output to `stdout`, and similarly if no `-in` argument is provided then it looks for input on `stdin`. Let's try piping input to this program as a string using `stdin`. This can save us the trouble of having to write an input or output file, since we can just pipe string data into the program, and catch the stdout as a string. That is much more efficient. First I'll show the normal way of running `muscle` with file inputs and then the better way of using pipes. "

    "\n",
    "Raxml doesn't allow input through `stdin` so we will have to write the data to a file. All programs are written differently, so you often need to examine the documentation or help command to find out how the input and outputs are used. In addition, raxml writes it's log information to stdout instead of stderr. Again, this is just something that some developers do. Because the output is always written to a file for raxml it doesn't really matter whether the log is written to stderr or stdout. Here we use the required argument `-n` to give a name to the output file. If an output file with that name already exists then it will raise an error. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The program raxml takes a lot of arguments which I won't describe for now, but these are the minimal number of arguments required to infer a tree using the algorithm designated. We will discuss some of the detail of phylogenetic inference in a later session. For now, its enough to know that the following program will take the aligned sequence data and infer the best phylogenetic tree based on the observed differences among sequences. "
